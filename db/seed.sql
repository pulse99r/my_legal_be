('2024-09-26 16:20','I never liked the term ''Naturals'' for the white keys and ''Accidentals'' for the black keys. Can you suggest any other terms? and while I am at it ... 
I feel the solfege syllables do,re,mi,fa,so,la,ti,do ... is a flawed system, and that becomes especially apparent when you do the ''accidentals'' ... because D is called "re" and Db would be called ''re'' also. That stinks. 
My solution (which will never happen ... )
do,ro,mo,fo,so,lo,to,do
thus ascending chromatic scale is
do,di,re,ri,mo,fo,fi,so,si,lo,li,do
the descending chromatic scale is
do,to,te,lo,le,so,se,fo,mo,me,ro,re,do',null,'2024-11-18'),
